// The notes API as a Cloudflare Worker in Go: the contract and
// handlers are in api/, the bindings in platform_js.go. Built with TinyGo for Wasm (mise run
// build) it runs on Workers; built for the host, transport.Run starts a plain HTTP server on
// :9900 (or $PORT) with an in-memory store (platform_other.go). transport carries the WebSocket in
// both places.
